## What is this app?
This is my first application done all by myself.
It's a culinary blog with cake & sweets recipes, advanced search and users.
This is developed to and will eventually replace my sister's current blog - candycompany.pl.

## Database
postresql

## TO BE DONE:
- remove password validation on user account editting
- add fixed search bar below the navbar
- fix flash messages
- anchor the view not to pull up after action
- add carousel with most recent possts in HOME
- Finish nested comments - restrict to one level down
